## How to Make a Commit

To make a commit in your Git repository, follow these steps:

1. **Add changes to the Git stage** with the command `git add --file`.
   - This command adds changes in the specified file to the Git stage, preparing them to be included in the next commit.
2. **Enter the command `yarn co`** in the terminal and then navigate through the options.
   - This command starts the `@s-ui/mono` tool, which will guide you through the process of creating a commit.
3. **Choose the workspace** where the modified files are located.
   - The workspace is the working area where the files you have modified are located. Make sure to select the correct workspace to include changes in the commit.
4. **Choose the type of commit** (fix, refactor, test, chore).
   - The type of commit describes the nature of the changes you are making. For example, if you are fixing a bug, you can select "fix." If you are refactoring code, you can select "refactor."
5. **Write a description of the command** and then finish by pressing enter.
   - The command description should be clear and concise, and should explain what changes you are making and why. Once you have written the description, press enter to finish and create the commit.

Remember that the tool used to make commits is an npm package called `@s-ui/mono`. You can find more information about this package and how to use it on its npm page.
